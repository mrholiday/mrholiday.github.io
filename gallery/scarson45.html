				I'm not a big fan of English songs actually. All the English songs I listened are from, like, Phil Collins, BLUE, or are some occasionally recommended songs like "Bleeding Love" by Leona Lewis or something else. The first time I listened to Scars on 45 is when I picked up the soundtrack of my favorite series <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>. Their song "Heart On Fire" impressed me a lot. At first I thought it was performed by the Alex and Izzie, because of their very similar voices to the singers...(I really wish it was true!)

				Then I found out this album, and I played it from the start. Maybe the opening is always the best, or at least, the most powerful and impressive one. "Warning Sign" made me keep playing. The following "Breakdown" presents a very grand scene, and the lyrics are like poems: "<i>With days like that well pain's no wonder / No-one to write your name on a rain-soaked beach / And who's gonna call come storms through the fields of thunder / You're caught between the breakdown</i>". After that I know, "Beauty's Running Wild" is their first hit in series <i>CSI: New York</i>, rather than "Heart On Fire". Both of them became my favorites.

				I bought the burned CD, and it is the first time I buy a non-Jpop music CD. :P
