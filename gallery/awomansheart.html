			<div class="title"><h3>滴草由実 (Yumi Shizukusa)</h3></div>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Actually at first I didn't notice this album, or didn't pay much attention to this album. I did listen to several songs of it, but disppointment is the first word came to my mind. In my mind, Shizukusa was a singer who is very good at R&B, but this album listened more electronic. So I put it for a while. After several months, I listened again, by accident. But this time, I was shocked.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">The opening song, "I don't Love You", impressed me a lot, both for the dark urban electronic style and the strong lyrics. Ironically, the title song "A woman's heart" didn't impressed me a lot. The next climax is "Dreaming". This song has a music video, with some pictures of NYC. The feeling of industry combined perfectly with this song. "Move it" is a very strong electronic dance music. Indeed, I believe everyone who are listening to this song will moving their bodies with the rhythm. Finally, "約束" moves me with its encouraging lyrics: "Starring at the sky after the rain. / Throw that old umbrella away which have been protecting me." I know maybe this is what she wanted to say to herself. I can see very clearly in this album, about a girl's growth. Interestingly, this is the remark that much of the reviews from the fans forum or Amazon.co.jp make. I remember her debut single, "Don't you wanna see me oh tonight" (released in 2003), which has a very strong sense of urban R&B. At that time she was just 19 years old. Now she has grown up and became a woman, as the album's title.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">It's really a shame that this excellent just sold for 450 copies in the whole Japan. I believe this is not the fault of herself, rather her recording label. I believe that anyone who testified the growth of this girl won't miss this album. Now the tenth anniversary is coming. Although it may not be reality that she will get much more fans, I will support her, definitely. And I want to say her: Thank you for showing your growth and excellent pieces of music to us, who will support you forever.
