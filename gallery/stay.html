			<div class="title"><h2>STAY～夜明けのSoul～ (2009.09.30)</h2></div>
			<div class="title"><h3>GARNET CROW</h3></div>
			<p style="text-align:justify"> If it was several years ago, I wouldn't hesitate to say that GARNET CROW's, my definitely favorite band, fifth album "THE TWILIGHT VALLEY" is the top album. After this album was released, it changed. Also, almost all the albumes released before they disbanded in spring 2013, are my favorites. This album, "STAY～夜明けのSoul～ (STAY～The Soul in the Dawn～)", has so many stories.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify"> I have to mention that this album is the most "literary" one. As usual, all the lyrics were written by Azuki 七 (Azuki Nana), who was also the pianist in this band. From the titles, you can sense the "literary". Track 1, "Hello Sadness" is from the famous French writer Francoise Sagan's (1935-2004) short novel "Bonjour tristesse (Hello Sadness)". What's more, in the lyrics, she also wrote about Sagan: "Even now when I read Sagan, I can feel the sound of the waves". The darkness of this song conveys perfectly the view of GARNET CROW, and it is this sense of darkness and depth that makes GARNET CROW outstanding. Track 2, as the name shows, "One Hundred Years of Solitude", presents a very grand scale, just like Gabriel Garcia Márquez's (1927-present) literature "One Hundred Years of Solitude". You can feel the grand history, grand world and life. Although I'm not sure whether this song has something to do with the novel or not, they give me the same feeling. Track 7, "Stay", was inspired by Marguerite Duras (1914-1996), also a writer well-known by her novels, like "The Lover". In the lyrics, Azuki also writes something that: "". Track 11, "Rainy Soul", was written in memory of one of the greatest novelist in Japan: 太宰治 (Ohsaki Dazai, 1909-1948), who has ever committed suicide five times for love, and his top novel "人間失格 (Human Lost)". Maybe it was because that 2009 is the 100th anniversary for his birthday. This song is very quiet but also depressive, from both lyrics and music. You hear 中村由利 (Yuri Nakamura), the vocalist also the composer who wrote all the music of GARNET CROW, sings like: "You just need to know that human are simply human. If you think love is necessary only when you are hurt, then you will exist. HUMAN LOST." Here, the meaning of "HUMAN LOST" is that "Losing the quality for being a human."
			</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify"> Besides those songs with very strong sense of literature, other songs are also excellent. Track 3, "花は咲いて ただ揺れて(album ver.)(Flowers Just Bloom, and Waver with the Wind)" is just like a poem, showing the irreversible and unchangeable destiny of flowers. "Elysium" shows the pessimistic opinion of love, saying: "In the light of sadness and the darkness of hope, I am searching for the Elysium for exile.", and "I don't believe in forever love", and so forth. "日々のほとり (Being Next to the Days)", "夢のひとつ (A Dream)" and "恋のあいまに (In the Intervals of Love)" are also exceptional ballads. Especially, they make you feel just like walking in a slightly rainy night when you hear "日々のほとり" and "恋のあいまに". "夢のひとつ" is the one that I remember most since it has been released as the 27th single in 2008. Again, the lyrics: "I just see a dream, let's go back to tomorrow". 
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:justify"> Fortunately, this album was released when I was a second-year student in my high school, and when I was so interested in literature. Even at that time I wanted to be a writer. I read almost all the books mentioned in this album, except works by Duras. Whenever I read a book, I played this album to produce the ambient, and this works! The design of this album is also impressive. When I first listened to the best opening song "Hello Sadness", just like the title, I feel myself standing in a forest in the dawn. Then the rushing rhythm makes me feel riding a horse. There is a white horse in the booklet of this album, and it is really a correct decision.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify"> I said so much because this is the best band I ever met, and this is also the best album. I think that, if you are interested in literature, you have to listen this album. It inspires your imagination, and the darkness will surround yourself so tightly that you won't never get out of it. I love this feeling: endless darkness!
