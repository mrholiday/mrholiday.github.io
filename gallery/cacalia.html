			<p style="text-align:justify"> Organs Café is a band from Japan, whose genre is Jazz, Bossa Nova and Blues. They have stopped releasing their records since 2007 (but continued to perform in pubs till 2011, as far as I know). Although they were in act from 2001, there were only little singles and albums released. In fact, there are only two members in this band: 加藤　沙香菜(Sakana Kato) is the vocalist and wrote all the lyrics; 林　良(Ryo Hayashi) plays the keyboard and wrote all the songs. I know this band from the single 「ah～Never forget you」 when I was shopping second-hand CDs. After that day I took the trip to Hong Kong. That song, along with its sense of peaceful summer and beach, impressed me a lot that whenever I listen to that, I recall my days in Hong Kong.
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:justify"> The title song, which is also their first single, 「カカリア」(CACALIA) sounds like mumble. I have no idea what the CACALIA means, but it may refer to a kind of flower. At first I did not like this debut single, compared to their 2nd single 「ah～Never forget you」. Later, I found that this song is very comfortable -- so is any other song performed by Organs Café. I guess it is their quiet, dark and warm arrangement and comfortable and soft voice of Sakana. The following songs, from track 3 to track 10 are all good pieces.

			<p style="text-align:justify"> The 11th track, 「恋風」(The Wind of Love), is my favorite song by Organs Café, not only in this album. It starts with gentle piano sound, and goes with Blues. The lyrics is depicting a woman who is recalling her first love. There is no deep regret or very strong emotion in the lyrics and the melody; instead, it goes very gently. But one can feel the sorrow in the lyrics. It recalls the dear old days when you loved someone secretly without the courage to tell him/her. After that, you meet many people, you miss many people, and you bid many people farewell. You love and hurt again and again, till it becomes, like, routine. Then what you miss is your first love, and the first time when you knew (or even not) that the feeling inside you is called LOVE. Even I would like to rearrange this song to a piano solo, because it moves me a lot.
