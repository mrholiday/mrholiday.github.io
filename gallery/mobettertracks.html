			<div class="title"><h3>rumania montevideo</h3></div>
			<p style="text-align:justify">An excellent five-member band, rumania montevideo, only existed from 1999 to 2002, and this album "MO' BETTER TRACKS" is their last album. Without any collection or best selection, only original album. Af first, I listened only to their debut single "Still for your love", which was their peak of career. Presumably, because of their vintage rock style, they were not so popular at that time. But after I found this album, I think I found the best album in this world.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">The vocalist who also wrote all of their lyrics, 三好真美 (Mami Miyoshi), said that this is an album about "Rain". This is obvious, because we see there are three classical and perfect songs with the word "rain" within them: "HARD RAIN", "tender rain" and "Rain". The first one is filled with clear drums voice, but the rain actually refers to "Other's view", according to their official website. The second one is filled with tender but strong emotion, and the coda, along with multiple instruments and chorus, is very impressive. The last one is the hard rock, like the rain are beating the ground. All of them are my favorite. She also said that, the song "All by myself" depicts the scene after the rain stopped. This song is my favorite, and the lyrics always encourages me all the time. Finally, the album ends with "start all over again", which is also a very encouraging song. </p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">They did not create so much songs, but almost all of them are treasures. They have disbandded for a long time, but you still can find their official website, maintained by their company GIZA studio (<a href="http://giza.co.jp/rumania" target=_blank>click here</a>). It is not so easy, and I wish the website will not be closed someday.</p>
