			<div class="title"><h3>倉木麻衣 (Mai Kuraki)</h3></div>
			<p style="text-align:justify">An album all about "Life" and "Dream", my favorite album by Mai Kuraki. The theme color is purple and white, so you'll just feel this album simple and clean. The top album in winter! It is a surprise that after so many years since she switched her style from dark R&B to J-pop, we can still hear Mai Kuraki sings her best R&B songs, especially the song "One Life", "I Like it Like that" and "Wonderland" which I love most. "One Life" and "I Like it Like that" are written by European musicians and recorded in Stockholm, Sweden. In the end, you can hear her cover the well-known song "Over the Rainbow". The sound in "One Life": "Don't give up One Life / It's just No Sugar Coffee" opens the whole album, and the last words of the song even of the whole album "The dream that you dare to dream / really do come true" successfully bring the album to the end. For those who like J-pop and pop music, this album will not be a smart choice. For me and whoever loves European R&B, however, this is definitely the NO.1.
