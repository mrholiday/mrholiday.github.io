			<div class="title"><h2>HEART STATION (2008.03.19)</h2></div>
			<div class="title"><h3>宇多田ヒカル (Utada Hikaru)</h3></div>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Actually, the song "HEART STATION" is the fisrt song by Utada Hikaru I listened, and I didn't listened to it frequently as Mai Kuraki's or GARNET CROW's. When I was on the plane back to Beijing from Washington DC in summer 2013, I was so boring and my iPod was out of charge. So I turned on the device on the plane and seek whatever I was interested in. Unfortunately (maybe also fortunately), only Utada Hikaru was the one that I had listened. On the plane, I listened lots of her songs from the best album "Single Collection Vol.2", which reminded me of "HEART STATION". After back to home, I listened to the whole album "HEART STATION", and was very impressed by her songs.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Interestingly, this album was released only around two months after another my favorite Mai Kuraki's album "ONE LIFE". They presented very similar style, no matter in the album design or songs: simple, clean, transparent and light.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">In this album, "Fight The Blues", "Beautiful World", "Flavor Of Life" (not the ballad version) and "Celebrate" are my favorite songs, and I love every song in this album as well. As Utada said, the album is very deliberately simple, which is very different from her latest Japanese album "ULTRA BLUE". This album is strongly recommended!</p>
